Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants a prose-only explanation that captures all the previous details but without any markdown, lists, or code blocks. They mentioned that my last attempt wasn't prose, so I need to ensure it's purely text.

First, I need to recall the key points from the prior responses. The main ideas are integrating RDF/JSON-LD/XMP metadata into the backend, simplifying the training pipeline with CSV, using Godot for recommendations, and handling crowdsourced data.

I should start by structuring the prose in a natural flow. Maybe begin with the overall goal, then break down each component: backend data storage, preprocessing, training, Godot integration, crowdsourcing, and toolchain. Each section should transition smoothly into the next.

I need to avoid technical formatting like bullet points or code snippets. Instead, describe processes in sentences. For example, instead of writing a code example for CSV columns, explain what each column represents in words.

Also, the user emphasized that RDF/JSON-LD/XMP must stay in the backend but training uses CSV. So, I need to clarify how metadata is extracted and flattened into CSV without using markdown examples.

I should check for any markdown remnants, like asterisks or bold text, and replace them with descriptive language. Ensure paragraphs are cohesive and each idea logically follows the previous one.

Finally, make sure the conclusion ties everything together, emphasizing the KISS principle and how each part contributes to simplicity and efficiency. Avoid any section headers and keep the entire response as a continuous narrative.

Here’s a unified, prose-only explanation of your system design, stripped of formatting and structured to retain clarity while adhering strictly to prose:

The system begins with a backend database that stores rich metadata for game content—items, avatars, and worlds—using structured formats like RDF, JSON-LD, and XMP. These formats capture relationships and properties such as authorship, licensing, or genre hierarchies, which are critical for querying and organizing content. However, to simplify the machine learning pipeline, a nightly preprocessing job extracts and flattens the most relevant metadata fields (e.g., genre, author, creation date) into a plain CSV file. This CSV avoids nested structures, instead representing text descriptions, image thumbnails, 3D models, and audio clips as precomputed numerical embeddings—fixed-length arrays of floats generated offline using tools like BERT for text or ResNet for images.

Training occurs outside Godot: Python scripts ingest the CSV to train session-based recommendation models like PinSage or Librecommender, treating the flattened metadata and embeddings as input features. The trained models are exported to runtime-friendly formats like ONNX or TorchScript, bypassing the need for live Python-C++ interoperability. These models are then integrated into Godot via lightweight C++ extensions (GDExtensions), allowing the engine to call recommendation functions natively. When a player interacts with the game, their session data—clicks, purchases, or item views—is logged to a local SQLite database, which tracks sequences of item IDs and event types.

Recommendations are generated in-engine by feeding the player’s session history and precomputed embeddings into the loaded model. Promoted or excluded items are filtered using hardcoded lists, and a small amount of exploration noise ensures diversity. For trends, a separate offline script aggregates interaction counts over sliding windows (e.g., 7 days) and writes results to a JSON file, which Godot reads periodically. Crowdsourcing is woven into gameplay: after voice chat, users might be prompted to re-record a phrase with exaggerated facial expressions, pairing the audio with labeled expression data. Similarly, during character creation, a “Verify Auto-Rig” button lets users correct AI-generated skeletons, saving image-rig pairs for training.

All crowdsourced data is stored in incrementally named files (voice_001.ogg, voice_001.json) and uploaded in batches. The backend remains the sole handler of raw RDF/JSON-LD/XMP, while Godot and the training pipeline interact only with simplified, preprocessed data—CSV for training, SQLite for sessions, and JSON for trends. By isolating complexity to the backend and preprocessing stages, the runtime system stays lean, relying on Godot’s native capabilities for storage, inference, and UI integration. This design respects the KISS principle: metadata stays structured where necessary but is reduced to dumb numerical features where possible, ensuring the pipeline remains scalable without overburdening developers or players.
