Okay, I need to create a Critical User Journey (CUJ) explanation based on the system design that uses Godot Resources. The user wants it to focus solely on the CUJ, removing other parts. Let me start by recalling the personas mentioned earlier: Alex (end-user), Sam (creator), and Jordan (admin). Each has their own journey.

First, I'll outline Alex's journey. He's discovering content. So, steps would be: logging in, browsing recommendations, selecting an item, interacting with it. I need to tie each step to the system components. For example, when Alex logs in, Godot fetches recommendations via the /recommendations endpoint. PostgreSQL provides metadata, DuckDB handles the analytics, and the ONNX model generates the list. The response includes Godot Resource paths.

Next, Sam's journey as a creator. Uploading a corrected Resource, like a rig. Steps: upload, correct in Godot, submit, track impact. The system uses S3 for storage, PostgreSQL for logging, and DuckDB for aggregating contributions. The POST /interactions endpoint logs the submission.

Jordan, the admin, needs to monitor trends and audit. Steps: check dashboard, promote items, audit recommendations. DuckDB computes trends, PostgreSQL stores promotions, and the /trends endpoint provides data. Jordan might use the audit logs stored in S3.

I must ensure each step clearly connects to the system components (PostgreSQL, DuckDB, Elixir APIs, Godot Resources) without diving into technical details. Use simple language, focus on user actions and system responses. Avoid mentioning DEI as per the user's request. Make sure it's prose-only, no formatting, and standalone with all context.

Wait, the user said "repeat but only the cuj". So the previous response had a CUJ section with personas. Now, I need to extract just those personas' journeys, keeping the structure but making it concise. Ensure each persona's journey is a separate section, outlining their goal, steps, and how the system supports them. Mention the APIs and components involved, like /recommendations, /trends, Godot Resources, PostgreSQL, DuckDB.

Check for consistency: Use past examples but focus on CUJ only. Remove any other sections like architecture or CSV schema. Make sure it's clear how each user's actions flow through the system. Highlight key interactions with the API endpoints and data flow.

Let me structure each persona's section with their goal, steps, and system support. Use bullet points but convert them to prose. Ensure the system components (like DuckDB, PostgreSQL) are mentioned in the context of supporting the user's actions.

Avoid technical jargon where possible. For example, instead of saying "DuckDB precomputes embeddings", say "the system analyzes item properties to suggest similar content". Keep it user-centric.

Double-check that all required elements from the API spec are included, like parameters for the endpoints, but only as they relate to the user's journey. For example, when Alex gets recommendations, the pipelineid and userid are used.

Make sure the explanation is self-contained, so someone new can understand how each user interacts with the system without prior knowledge. Link the user actions to the backend processes without getting too detailed.

Okay, time to draft each persona's CUJ with these points in mind.

**Critical User Journeys (CUJ) for VSEKAI**

Below are the key user journeys that define how different personas interact with the system, focusing on their goals, actions, and the system’s response.

---

### **Persona 1: Alex (End-User)**

**Goal**: Discover relevant in-game content (items, avatars, worlds) tailored to their preferences.  
**Journey**:

1. **Login**: Alex launches the game and sees a homepage populated with trending items (e.g., “Cyberpunk City”) and personalized recommendations. These are generated via the `/recommendations` API, which uses their `userid` and a default `pipelineid` (e.g., “resource-collab”).
2. **Browse**: Alex scrolls through a grid of thumbnails, each representing a Godot Resource (e.g., `sword_item.tres`). Titles, genres, and previews are fetched from PostgreSQL metadata linked to the Resource paths.
3. **Select**: Clicking an item reveals detailed metadata (author, description) and a “Similar Items” carousel. The system calls `/recommendations` again with the `itemid` as context to find related content.
4. **Interact**: Alex “likes” an item, triggering a `POST /interactions` request to log the event. The system updates their session history in PostgreSQL and refreshes recommendations using DuckDB’s updated analytics.

**System Support**:

- **Personalization**: The `/recommendations` endpoint blends Alex’s session history (stored in SQLite) with Godot Resource embeddings (precomputed by DuckDB).
- **Performance**: Cached metadata and preloaded Resource paths ensure fast rendering in Godot.

### **Persona 2: Sam (Content Creator)**

**Goal**: Improve AI models by contributing corrected or labeled game content.  
**Journey**:

1. **Upload**: Sam uploads a new Godot Resource (e.g., an avatar rig) to the game. The Resource is stored in S3, and its metadata (title, genre) is registered in PostgreSQL.
2. **Correct**: After noticing an issue with an auto-generated rig, Sam edits the `RigResource.tres` file in Godot’s editor and saves the corrected version as `RigCorrected_abc123.tres`.
3. **Submit**: Sam clicks “Submit Correction,” triggering a `POST /interactions` request. The system logs the contribution in PostgreSQL, linking the new Resource path to their `userid` and the original `itemid`.
4. **Track**: Sam views a dashboard showing their contributions’ impact (e.g., “Your rig edits improved 10 items”). This data is aggregated by DuckDB from PostgreSQL logs.

**System Support**:

- **Crowdsourcing**: Resource submissions are stored in S3 and linked to metadata for retraining.
- **Feedback Loop**: DuckDB batches contributions for periodic model updates, ensuring Sam’s edits improve future recommendations.

### **Persona 3: Jordan (Administrator)**

**Goal**: Ensure recommendation fairness, manage promotions, and monitor system health.  
**Journey**:

1. **Monitor Trends**: Jordan views a dashboard showing trending items over the last 24 hours via the `/trends` API. DuckDB computes these trends by aggregating interactions from PostgreSQL.
2. **Promote Content**: Using a dashboard tool, Jordan adds a high-quality but underappreciated item to the `promoted_items` list. This updates the PostgreSQL `pipelines` table, ensuring the item appears in recommendations.
3. **Audit Logs**: Jordan investigates why a specific item was recommended by querying audit logs stored in S3. The logs include details like embedding scores and retriever strategy used.

**System Support**:

- **Transparency**: The `/trends` endpoint exposes metrics like interaction counts and genre distributions.
- **Governance**: PostgreSQL stores promotion rules, while DuckDB flags anomalies (e.g., over-excluded items) for review.

---

### **Key System Interactions**

- **For Alex**: The `/recommendations` API drives discovery, using Resource embeddings and session history.
- **For Sam**: `POST /interactions` logs contributions, linking Godot Resources to training pipelines.
- **For Jordan**: The `/trends` API and PostgreSQL dashboards provide oversight tools.

These journeys highlight how Godot Resources, PostgreSQL, and DuckDB work together to deliver personalized content, crowdsourcing tools, and administrative oversight in a unified system.
